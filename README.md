This is a skeleton project for highlighting:
* MySQL syntax
* project structure (not perfect but a good start)

This does not get deep into protobuf. If you want to get into protobuf, there is a protoc compiler for creating .proto files and a protobuf "runtime" or something (that is, a package that you actually import to be able to use it in your python project). Protobuf stuff involves:
* .proto file (python does NOT read this. This is a file using the protobuf language. No matter which language you're using, you generate a language-specific file based off of this .proto file.) Your machine needs the protoc compiler to compile this into a language-specific file
* projectname_pb2.py file. This is what python actually reads from when you import protobuf. It is generated by protoc. It is a bunch of imports and gobbledygook. Usually you import the class name you want from this python file. And you use api_message = ClassName(); api_message.ParseFromString(response.content) Then you can use dot syntax to access nested objects
